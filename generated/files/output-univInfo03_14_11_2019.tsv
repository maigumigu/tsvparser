UCL is based in central London, though it also has branch campuses in Qatar and Australia. Additionally, UCL has exchange and research agreements as well as other types of partnerships with universities around the world, such as the University of Montreal in Canada and Zhejiang University in China. UCL students hail from around 150 countries, and tuition costs are higher for students from outside the U.K. and European Union. University housing is guaranteed for first-year undergraduates. The UCL academic calendar has three terms, and the language of instruction is English. UCL has 11 academic divisions: arts and humanities; brain sciences; engineering; education; laws; life sciences; mathematical and physical sciences; medical sciences; population health sciences; social and historical sciences; and the Bartlett, a division focused on architecture and planning. The university is affiliated with several hospitals and medical centers, such as the University College Hospital and the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital. Research takes place across the academic disciplines at UCL, but the main multidisciplinary research domains are neuroscience, personalized medicine, populations and lifelong health, the environment and eResearch. The university has been associated with research accomplishments throughout its history. One example is that a UCL professor won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1904 for his discovery of noble gases, including neon gas.

USTC, as the university is sometimes called, is situated in Hefei, the capital of China’s Anhui province, and has five campuses within the city located relatively close to each other. Around 1.5 percent of the student body hails from abroad. Many of the university's international students receive financial support from one of three sources: the USTC Scholarship, the Chinese Government Scholarship or a fellowship that the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the World Academy of Sciences offers. All three types of aid cover tuition and provide a stipend for other education-related costs. University housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students. USTC has more than a dozen schools, many of which are devoted to the sciences, but the university also has academic divisions focused on subjects such as public affairs and business. Additionally, the USTC School of the Gifted Young offers instruction for advanced students. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar. The primary language of instruction is Chinese, though some master’s and most doctoral programs are also offered in English. More than 70 percent of undergraduate students participate in USTC’s Research Program for Undergraduates, which takes place at university labs and Chinese Academy of Sciences research institutes. Among the research labs that USTC operates are the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale and the State Key Laboratory of Fire Science.
